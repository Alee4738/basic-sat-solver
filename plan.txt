CS 161 HW 4 Plan



DOING:
	Make test cases



TODO:
	a state is a list of variable assignments!
	variables: x1 x2 ... xn
	domain: {t, f}, negative or positive
	constraints: constraints

	the notion of an initial state: 
		empty variable assignment should not 



	We have 2 options: search, infer
	Goal method:
		Backtracking search using Most constrained variable and forward checking and variable ordering
		TODO: How do I do variable ordering?

DONE
	Write goal test function
		Given a sat problem and a variable assignment, check to see whether that variable assignment solves the sat problem


Scratch work thinking:
	failing a constraint is currently the same as not having any variables that the constraint defines
