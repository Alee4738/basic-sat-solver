CS 161 HW 4 Plan



DOING:
	



TODO:

	Inference function to deduce the value
		this is about modeling the domain of a function
	Forward checking


	We have 2 options: search, infer
	Goal method:
		using Most constrained variable and forward checking
		TODO: How do I do variable ordering?

DONE
	Write goal test function
		Given a sat problem and a variable assignment, check to see whether that variable assignment solves the sat problem
	Make test cases
	Implement basic backtracking search
	select-unasssigned-variable: 
		1. most constraining variable (most constrained variable does not apply because it goes into inference)
		This is about the number of connections it has
		how many clauses this guy is involved in!
